    <h1>Privacy Policy for Fashion Trend Analyzer</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> July 3, 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Fashion Trend Analyzer</strong> ("the App," "we," "us," or "our") handles information. This app is a personal, non-commercial project designed for educational and data analysis purposes. It interacts with the Pinterest API to analyze public trends.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        Our App is designed to analyze trends, not people. We do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or process any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from our users or from Pinterest users.
    </p>
    <p>
        The only data the App handles is aggregated, anonymized trend data provided by the Pinterest API, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Trending keywords (e.g., "summer dress," "streetwear").</li>
        <li>Anonymized search volume and performance metrics for those keywords.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>
        The anonymized trend data is used exclusively for the following purposes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>To display fashion trends within the App's dashboard.</li>
        <li>To analyze changes in trend popularity over time for educational purposes.</li>
        <li>To learn about data visualization and API integration.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> share, sell, rent, or trade any data with third parties. The App is for personal use only and does not have any commercial function. All data retrieved from the Pinterest API is used solely within the App's dashboard for the owner's analysis.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        We take reasonable measures to protect the information within our control. The connection to the Pinterest API is made securely using credentials stored in a safe environment. Since we do not collect any personal data, the risk to individual privacy is minimal.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
        As we do not collect any personal data, there is no personal information to access, change, or delete.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>
        If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact the project owner through the GitHub repository where this project is hosted.
